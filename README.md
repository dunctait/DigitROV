# How to use
Either configure appropriately to connect to your Arduino (or Pi etc), or run the ArduinoSimulator project included. Plug in an XBox 360 controller and hopefully you're off

# Notes
This project was written in 2013 for my own personal testing, so while it isn't polished or public-ready there are people on the homemade ROV forums that ask for it therefore I've reuploaded it onto GitHub
